              I am from Rourkela,the steel city of Odisha.I did my matriculation and intermediate from Ispat English Medium School,Rourkela.I did Btech in Electronics and telecommunication engineering (2017) from Orissa Engineering College.Right from childhood days, I love sports.I started with Cricket,during school days I learnt Football,Volleyball,Basketball.I learnt Badmintion and Table Tennis while in college.I got placed in Sutherland India but couldnt join it beacause my mother was diagnosed with ovary cancer.To a middle class family even the word cancer can turn the world upside down.For me "PARENTS ARE EVERYTHING",they did everything  to make sure their child doent get discomfort.So it was time for payback  I decided not to  join the company and be with her.After a year,her immunity weakened by the medications.So i decided not to go anywhere till she recover.Deep down i went to depression because all of my friends were working and I still have no clue what to do.Few months later I decided to do something and started doing excercises.Then started learning html,css but only basics wont help!!.So I googled about coding bootcamps and got to know about AltCampus.

              Why do you want to learn web development?
            </div>
            <div class="response">
              I was fascinated to how the website works!.I got to know it is written in html,css ,JavaScript combining with frameworks,backend. I love to see my imagination come to life. I want to be a web developer to bring my ideas to life and help others see what I think a better world looks like.And making money with what you like is cherry on a cake beacuse you are doing what you like and doesnt make you feel stressed!.You got to learn more things as you dive deeper into it.

              MY BROTHER:He is the person from whom I have learnt to be determined,fearless,the urge to do something.His name is HIMANSHU,my twin elder brother.It was in 1st year of college when he met with an accident in which his knee cap got displaced and doctors told he wont be able to be play anymore,if he does it might get displace again.We both love sports and on hearing this he was sad.After the surgery it took around a year to walk properly.He was back on field after 2 years of accident.Those two years were crucial  for him.It's this two years which taught him to live fearlessly,confident,determined and most important to think "YOU CAN DO IT!!".Seeing him do it I admire him a lot.

              What's your preferred learning style? How do you think you learn
              something best?
            </div>
            <div class="response">
              I prefer offline learning that is when the teacher interacts with the students giving some riddles,crack some jokes,makes class entertaining so that students should not feel burden over what they are learning.But I learn something best while having group study,its the best way to learn.Group study helps you to learn faster and hoping the same at AltCampus.

              I played 5 matches in day which I consider the hardest thing I have ever done.It was in 2nd year in college and only one  my college to represent two games Volley ball and Football.Our college participated in inter college tournament,on First day there were 2 football,2 volleyball match and on day Two we had 1 volleyball,1 football match.Due to bad weather 1 football and 2 volleyball match was resheduled to next day which comprises to 5 matches and both games were scheduled altenately.After 2 matches,I was exhausted and thinking of three more matches was even  impossible but I somehow convinced my mind "I CAN DO IT!!". I played rest of the matches and we were in semi finals of both games.

              Being unemployed,I want to upgrade my skills on web development because in todays world the only thing which matter is SKILLS.I'm stuck with basics of html,css and javascript,I want to know its practical applications  .I  prefer face to face teaching,moreover there would me like minded people,which is good for learning.As we all would be learning on Web Development,I can do group study.I feel these six months can really give a boost to my career.I dont want to be a burden on my father anymore,so I want to join ALTCAMPUS  and  the cost of living at Dharamsala is less as mentioned in your webiste.I want these six months should be last time my father  investing on me. THANKYOU.
